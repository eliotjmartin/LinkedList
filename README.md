# LinkedList

This project was created for week 7 of CIS 212 Class Encore. 

The goal of this project is to familiarize students with the concept of a linked list. In the Class Encore sessions, I will provide students with the main function and the node structure in the ll.c file, and ask that they implement the print, destroy, and reverse functions.
